Steps to make the project work

1 - Migrate data from sql script to phpmyadmin database.

2 - Inside the SQL file will be the administrator user for connection through the webpage. Anyway I leave it here below
                username = elchuli3000@gmail.com
                password: cct123

3 - Place the database username and password in the _dbconnect.php file in the Connector folder. By default it will be

                username = "root";
                pasword = "";

4 - With this you should be able to establish the connection and therefore the usability of the project.
